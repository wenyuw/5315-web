      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is the world's leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate "works on my machine" problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps. <br/>- <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.<br/>

And importantly, Docker is open source. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box. <br/>- <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker">opensource.com</a>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. NGINX is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.<br/> - <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">nginx.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>Nginx is a web server, which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache. Created by Igor Sysoev in 2004, it runs on Unix, Linux, BSD variants, macOS, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and Windows. Nginx is free and open source software, released under the terms of a BSD-like license.<br/> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">wikipedia.org</a>
